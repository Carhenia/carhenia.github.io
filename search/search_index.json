We strongly recommend you don't use optifine with our mod packs, as it conflicts with some of our mods, and blocks such as chests may appear invisible. However, If you'd still like to install it, you can follow the steps below. What is optifine? Optifine is a Minecraft optimization mod, which can help your computer to run Minecraft more efficiently by increasing the frame rate and improving graphics, with full support for HD textures and many options for configuration. Optifine allows for better control of in-game graphics and provides the usage of shaders. Installation Optifine does not allow for reuploads of its mod and curse forge will deny it almost instantly if attempted to include it in a mod pack, so you are required to install it yourself. It is important that you follow these steps exactly to ensure that it is being installed properly and will work. Step 1: Head over to https://optifine.net/downloads and click \u2018Show all versions\u2019 Step 2: Scroll down until you find Minecraft 1.16.5, On Optifine HD U G8, click (Mirror) It is VERY IMPORTANT that you download that exact version.

Drag your \u2018Optifine.1.16.5_HD_U_G8.jar\u2019 file into the Colonia \u2018mods\u2019 folder. Step 6: Optifine should now be in your mods folder. Congratulations! You installed Optifine. You should not have any issues running it but if you do, make sure to contact a staff member on our discord. Where can I build? Theoretically, you can build in any world, but please be aware that any dimension (except the overworld) can be reset at any time. We do give a few days' warnings before doing this to allow players to retrieve any property. Please view the \u2018How big is the world' section for more information on this What is the server IP? It is included in the mod pack, but if missing, the address is mc.nebulanetwork.net. Where can I apply for staff? tba My golden shovel/stick isn't working! You may need to type the /claimtool command for them to activate. You can also use /claim and use your free hand How big is the world? The center of each dimension is at x 0 and z 0 coordinates. Below are the sizes of each of the dimensions on the official server. If a world has a border of 5000 blocks, it means that the border is 2500 blocks from the center. totaling to a 5000x5000 block area. If a If a world reset is to happen, the server is required to go into maintenance until the entire world generates. We will give a few days warning before this happens. Dimension Border Size Can be reset? Overworld 10k No. Nether 5k Yes End 10k Yes Alheim 5k Only if absolutely required. Mining 5k Yes Everbright 5k Only if absolutely required.

How to install & use litematica The main feature of litematica is to display a \"hologram\" version of a schematic, which shows you exactly how to build the structure and where to place the blocks. It also includes a (configurable) overlay to highlight missing, extra, or wrongly placed blocks. Litematica is a client-side mod that you can use on our Colonia server to help you with builds. Downloads Head over to this website and download the two following jar files. Make sure you download these two exact versions otherwise you will not be able to join the server. litematica-forge-1.16.5-0.0.0-dev.20210917.jar malilib-forge-1.16.5-0.10.0-dev.21+beta.1.jar You also need to download this config file, as the default conflicts with GriefDefender. The password is Colonia Install Once you have downloaded the three files, it's time to install them. Step 1: Head over to your mod pack directory. You can access it here Step 2: Place your litematica and malilib jar files into your \u2018mods\u2019 folder. It should look like this. Place your litematica.json file in your config folder. If you've already launched the mod pack with litematica installed, it will already have a litematica.json file. Replace it with this one. Using litematica I recommend you watch this video to understand how to use litematica. Please be aware that due to GriefDefender conflicts, I had to swap the tool from a stick to a golden axe. Enjoy! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFzyNtyN8qI How do I protect my base? You can use GriefDefender to claim your area, which is similar to grief prevention. Please see our Grief Defender page for more information. Please do not rely on MineColonies claims, as they may be disabled in the future. How do I whitelist a mod or texture pack? You can request a mod or texture pack to be whitelisted by visiting our forum. How do i disable/edit my HUD? Press \u2018o\u2019 and disable or change options. I can't use Mystical Fertilizer! Due to the right-click harvest feature that Pam's HarvestCraft adds, any \u2018block\u2019 interaction with plants is disabled (except vanilla fertilizer). You can still use modded fertilizer if you put them in your off-hand. How do I link my minecraft & discord accounts to the website? Step 1: On the left side of the page, hover over the account menu and select \u2018Account\u2019 Step 2: In your account settings, select \u2018connections\u2019 Step 3: Click \u2018connect\u2019 on minecraft and/or discord. A verification command should show up. Run this either in minecraft or discord (bot channel on Nebula Network) and you're done.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"Colonia/FAQ/#faq","text":"","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"Colonia/FAQ/#how-do-i-install-optifine","text":"We strongly recommend you don't use optifine with our mod packs, as it conflicts with some of our mods, and blocks such as chests may appear invisible.

This page aims to help the player to use grief defender to effectively protect their claim and use some of the flag functionality. Please visit the official wiki website for grief defender if you need more information. You can install WorldEdit CUI for better visuals. Getting Started To get started, the player can claim a golden shovel using the /kit command . This kit is available every 24 hours. You can also use the /claim command to claim a land using their free hand. Begin by selecting one of the corners of your claim. Ensure that you have enough claim blocks to cover your entire area. Once confirmed, head over to the opposite corner of the claim to create a shape. You should now see a shape with golden blocks in each corner. Next Steps As mentioned, some parts of the plugin are not functioning properly, this is most likely a conflict with forge or the server software we are using. It is recommended to not use the inventory GUI, but instead the chat GUI. You can switch between them using /claimgui . Some of the commands don't work well either, one bug I found was trying to set a flag and it said I don't have the proper permission. It worked fine when using the chat GUI You can use the /trust command to allow your friends access your claim. For easier navigation, we recommend only using the /gd command. You can switch through claims info and lists, see who's trusted, flags set in the current claim, etc. Flags You can edit flags by using the /gd command and selecting \u2018flags\u2019, while standing inside of your claim. and you can switch them between true and false by clicking on them, it also gives you more information when hovering over them. Bugs The following are some of the bugs I have encountered.

Your Crops are Ready (HYCAR) Differences in the Lite version Yes, you can still play on the server using the lite version of the modpack. The only difference between them is that the lite version is better optimized for lower-end computers and does not include as many client side mods. We highly recommend you don't use the lite version before trying the full version, as a lot of essential mods have been removed. The following client-side mods have been removed from the lite version and can also be removed from the full version. Mods highlighted in yellow are the ones I view as the \u2018laggiest\u2019 and would recommend removing if you are experiencing FPS drops. Name What it does Core Mod Core Mod Falling Leaves Adds a little particle effects to leaf blocks Traveler's Titles Adds RPG-like titles when entering biomes or dimensions. Dynamic Surroundings Dynamic Surroundings alters the player\u2019s visual and audible experience in Minecraft, and does not alter game mechanics. Sound Filters Adds reverb to caves and mutes sounds when you're underwater and when the sound source is behind a wall. Just Enough Items BetterF3 Replaces Minecraft's original debug HUD with a highly customizable, more human-readable HUD Just Enough Items Blur Adds a Gaussian blur shader to the background of all GUIs, which fades into give it a sleek look ConnectedTexturesMod Inventory HUD+ Better customizable HUD Equipment Compare Makes it easier to compare equipment at a glance. Iceberg YUNG\u2019s API ItemHighlighter Quickly find new items by showing an animated star on all newly-picked up items. Iceberg Farsight Lets you see farther on servers than the servers view distance. YUNG\u2019s API Better Third Person Adds independent rotation of the camera in a third person view. YUNG\u2019s API Shutup Experimental Settings Disables the annoying \"Experimental Features\" advice that appears every time you create or load a world with custom dimensions or world settings. YUNG\u2019s API Iceberg Core mod for ItemHighlighter and Equipment Compare mods.

The only difference between them is that the lite version is better optimized for lower-end computers and does not include as many client side mods. We highly recommend you don't use the lite version before trying the full version, as a lot of essential mods have been removed. The following client-side mods have been removed from the lite version and can also be removed from the full version. Mods highlighted in yellow are the ones I view as the \u2018laggiest\u2019 and would recommend removing if you are experiencing FPS drops.
