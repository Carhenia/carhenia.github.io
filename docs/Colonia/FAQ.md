Optifine is a Minecraft optimization mod, which can help your computer to run Minecraft more efficiently by increasing the frame rate and improving graphics, with full support for HD textures and many options for configuration. 

Optifine allows for better control of in-game graphics and provides the usage of shaders.

## How to install & use litematica

The main feature of litematica is to display a "hologram" version of a schematic, which shows you exactly how to build the structure and where to place the blocks. It also includes a (configurable) overlay to highlight missing, extra, or wrongly placed blocks.

Litematica is a client-side mod that you can use on our Colonia server to help you with builds. 

### Downloads

Head over to this website and download the two following jar files. Make sure you download these two exact versions otherwise you will not be able to join the server. 

litematica-forge-1.16.5-0.0.0-dev.20210917.jar
malilib-forge-1.16.5-0.10.0-dev.21+beta.1.jar

You also need to download this config file, as the default conflicts with GriefDefender. The password is Colonia

### Install

Once you have downloaded the three files, it's time to install them.

### Step 1:

Head over to your mod pack directory. You can access it here

![litematic step 1](images/faq/litematic_step1.jpg)

### Step 2:

Place your litematica and malilib jar files into your ‘mods’ folder.  It should look like this. 

![litematic step 2](images/faq/litematica_step2.jpg)

Place your litematica.json file in your config folder. If you've already launched the mod pack with litematica installed, it will already have a litematica.json file. Replace it with this one. 

### Using litematica

I recommend you watch this video to understand how to use litematica. Please be aware that due to GriefDefender conflicts, I had to swap the tool from a stick to a golden axe. Enjoy!
